Inspired by Chrome Dinosaur game (using Ncurses) \

To compile and run :

    gcc main.c -lcurses -o main.out
    /main.out


Make sure you have Ncurses library installed :

    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev


(If you're running with MacOS, include <termios.h> instead of <termio.h>)
